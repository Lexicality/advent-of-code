# Lexi's Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions for Advent of Code, some of them written on the day, increasingly
more of them written retrospectively.

A lot of the utilities and helpers are extremely rough and poorly thrown
together, especially the Rust ones since I used 2022 to _learn_ rust and
therefore all my code from then was idiot beginner code, but I've been gradually
improving matters.

Unfortunately some of the bugs/issues I've fixed for newer days have broken
previous days, so don't expect all of these to actually work ðŸ˜…

The `data/` submodule is private since the about page has this text on it:

> If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of
> Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.
